In the research studies on photosynthetic bacteria conducted in 1983, the dominant species identified were \"Chlorobium vibrioforme\" and \"Chlorobium limicola\". \"Thiocapsa roseopersicina\" and \"Rhodopseudomonas palustris\" were also found but at lower density.

Liberation of dissolved organic materials allows for bacterial growth, and bacteria are an important source of food for organisms in higher trophic levels. Consequently, chloroviruses have significant effects on carbon and nutrient flows, influencing freshwater ecosystem dynamics.
